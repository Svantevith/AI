    "Target leakage occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It\n",
    "is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available,\n",
    "not merely whether a feature helps to make good predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example will be helpful. Imagine you want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia.\n",

    "    got_pneumonia   age weight  male    took_antibiotic_medicine\n",
    "\n",
    "    False\t        65\t 100\t  False\t        False\n",

    "    True\t         58\t 100\t  False\t        True\n",
    "\n",
    "People take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. The raw data shows a strong relationship\n",
    "between those columns, but took_antibiotic_medicine is frequently changed after the value for got_pneumonia is\n",
    "determined. This is target leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model would see that anyone who has a value of False for took_antibiotic_medicine didn't have pneumonia. Since\n",
    "validation data comes from the same source as training data, the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the\n",
    "model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world, because even patients who will get\n",
    "pneumonia won't have received antibiotics yet when we need to make predictions about their future health.\n",

    "To prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be\n",
    "excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Generally: if a feature changes after the change of feature, it is useless and should be excluded:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - You can be sick, but haven't started taking medicines yet - False Negative\n",
    "        - You can take medicines prophylactically, even though you are not infected - False Positive"

    "    dependent at any time, moreover the value of the feature is not fixed and can change at anytime - target leakage is\n",
    "    inevitable. For example, if you use number of sold smartphones as a feature to predict number of sold headphones,\n",
    "    you will experience target leakage, because anytime number of sold smarphones changes during prediction, the target\n",
